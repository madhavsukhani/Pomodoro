            <h2>Welcome to Your Futuristic Pomodoro App</h2>
            <p>Boost your productivity, stay focused, and work smarter with the Pomodoro technique. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This method helps reduce mental fatigue and increases sustained concentration.</p>
            <p>Our Pomodoro app makes it easy to implement this technique into your daily routine. Whether you're working on an important project, studying for exams, or managing multiple tasks, our app is here to help you stay on track.</p>
            <p>It’s time to work smarter, not harder, and our Pomofocus app gives you the tools you need to do just that.</p>

        <div class="slide">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The Pomodoro technique is simple yet highly effective. Here's how it works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Set a timer for 25 minutes:</strong> Focus on one task without interruptions for a full Pomodoro session.</li>
                <li><strong>Work uninterrupted:</strong> During this time, avoid all distractions—turn off notifications, close unrelated tabs, and stay focused.</li>
                <li><strong>Take a short 5-minute break:</strong> When the timer goes off, take a break to recharge. Stretch, grab a coffee, or take a short walk to refresh your mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat the process:</strong> After four Pomodoro sessions, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes to rest and recover.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Pomodoro technique helps you maintain a high level of focus while giving your mind the rest it needs to stay sharp and productive.</p>
